### Markerless Motion and/or Pose and/or Face detection and/or tracking and  it's 3D reconstruction (in real time)

### Inspiration:
 1. [What is 3D reconstruction?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_reconstruction). This link gives a basic foundational idea on 3D reconstruction from images. **Using 3D reconstruction one can determine any object’s 3D profile, as well as knowing the 3D coordinate of any point on the profile.** from section **Motivation and applications** from this link is euphoric. Plus the methods for 3D reconstruction and in detail explanation of **Binocular stereo vision** and how it works is beautiful. There are other sources and external link.

### On Computer Graphics:
1. You sure will have to know much about computer Graphics too along with Computer Vision.
1. Also complete with TODO mentioned on [this OpenGL playground of](https://github.com/roshanpoudyal/3D_interactive_graphics_rendering_engine).

### Noteworthy open source libraries for visual computing:
1. [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/) is a software project that provides easy access to efficient and reliable geometric algorithms in the form of a C++ library. CGAL is used in various areas needing geometric computation, such as geographic information systems, computer aided design, molecular biology, medical imaging, computer graphics, and robotics.
2. [The Visualization Toolkit (VTK)](https://vtk.org/) is an open-source, freely available software system for 3D computer graphics, modeling, image processing, volume rendering, scientific visualization, and 2D plotting. It supports a wide variety of visualization algorithms and advanced modeling techniques, and it takes advantage of both threaded and distributed memory parallel processing for speed and scalability, respectively.
3. [The Point Cloud Library (or PCL)](http://pointclouds.org/) is a large scale, open project [1] for 2D/3D image and point cloud processing. The PCL framework contains numerous state-of-the art algorithms including filtering, feature estimation, surface reconstruction, registration, model fitting and segmentation.
4. [OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)](https://opencv.org/) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library.
5. [Dlib](http://dlib.net/) is a modern C++ toolkit containing machine learning algorithms and tools for creating complex software in C++ to solve real world problems. 
6. Althouh the libraries I mention in this point are far related to project topic, however they are noteworthy libraries under visual computing area :
    - [The Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL)](https://www.gdal.org/) is a computer software library for reading and writing raster and vector geospatial data formats. Although it is used for GIS data I have put it here because it can come under visual computing with raster GIS data.
    - Another, library which uses GDAL is [Orfeo Toolbox](https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/) which also can fall under visual computing because it works on using maching learning and computer vision with GIS raster images.
